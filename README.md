In preparation for getting a pair of huskies I have considered starting a business for grooming huskies and blowing out their winter coats and brushing. It would be great practice and help us understand the time commitment. Here is my pitch for the company:

Company name: "Husky Blow Jobs"
Tagline: "We blow your dogs so you don't have to!"

- Ad: "Your Husky won't forget our blow job."
- Ad: "We will blow your mind with how thorough we are!"
- Ad: "100% dog satisfaction guarantee"
- Ad: “Think your dog deserves a blow job? We are better at it, hire us to do it instead!”
- Ad: “Is your dog begging you for a blow job again? Let us handle it!”
- Ad: "Please don’t google our business…"
